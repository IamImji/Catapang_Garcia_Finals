  ### Demonstrating Morphological Erosion

  * **_Morphological erosion_** is a fundamental image processing operation in computer vision. It involves sliding a structuring element across an image, removing pixels at object boundaries. This process shrinks the foreground features of an image, emphasizing the significance of kernel size and shape in altering image features.

  ### Pokemon Images Erosion
  * This project discusses the concept of morphological erosion in terms of **Pokémon images** to present the idea of this technique in a novel and visually appealing way, so that its principles may be better understood. Through erosion with different kernel sizes, this project will demonstrate how it transforms the features of the images. The analysis shows that the morphological erosion is highly versatile and plays a key role in preprocessing images before performing more efficient computational analysis. This approach lets us have insight into how these morphological operations could actually be applied in real-life practice.
  
## _**ABSTRACT**_

* **Objective:** To demonstrate how morphological erosion in computer vision can be utilized by showing how the features of Pokémon images are reduced under different kernel sizes.
* **Approach:** To utilize _Morphological erosion_ as a basis in image processing technique to reduce the boundaries within Pokemon images, used for noise removal, simplification of shapes, and object segmentation.
* **Purpose:** To visualize and analyze how erosion with different kernel sizes affects the transformation of features in the Pokemon images.

## _**CONCLUSION**_

- In this experiment, the concept of **morphological erosion** was demonstrated using **Pokémon Images** as visual examples. We observed how the technique reduced the distinct features of the images by applying erosion with varying kernel sizes. Smaller kernel sizes resulted in subtle transformations, while larger kernels significantly simplified the images by removing finer details and contracting boundaries. This approach pointed out some real applications of morphological erosion in computer vision: removing noise, simplifying the shape, and segmenting an object. The visualization of such effects clearly explained how the erosion process affects the image features, which makes it more practical for preprocessing tasks in image analysis.
